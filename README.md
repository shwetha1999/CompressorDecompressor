# Compressor and Decompressor

### Project Objective
We sometimes face problems related to memory issues while saving or transferring any document or a file. Hence, there is a need to compress it so that it is reduced in size and can be transferred and processed easily. This project aims at compressing and decompressing different types of files stored in our computer system at a particular destination location.
  
### Some important reasons for developing this project are:
*The intention of file compression is to significantly reduce the space to store a file and transmit it.
-File compression also increases data transfer speed.
-There is also a chance of the file being corrupted and the user gets a file which is of no use.
-Compression also reduces the disk space required on the internet servers along with the time taken by the Internet servers to find the file stored on the hard drive.
-File Compression also provides file security by hiding information
 
### Technology and IDE used to run the project:
-Java 1.8 or above
-Eclipse or Netbeans or IntelliJ
 
### Algorithms used to compress and decompress
- #### GZIP Algorithm:
The GZIP stands for the GNU Zip algorithm and is used to compress the files into a gzip file format. This file format must not be confused with the ZIP archive file  format as the gzip works on a single file. The GZIP is based on the Deflate algorithm.

### Steps to run the project:
-When you run the main.java file, you will see window with 2 buttons
   1)select file to compress.
   2)select file to compress.
-Click any one of the button based on requirment,then your machine's browsing window will open
-Select the file you want to compress/decompress
-Now, we can see in the selected file folder, the compressed zip file / decompressed file has been saved
